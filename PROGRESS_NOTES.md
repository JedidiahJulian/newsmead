# NewsMead — Progress Notes

## 2026-07-01 — Bypass login gate for thesis research-instrument use

**Context:** NewsMead is being repurposed as a research instrument for a thesis
study. No real users, no personalization, no account system. The Firebase login
screen was blocking access to the home/article screens, and we don't want to
stand up the backend auth flow just to get past it.

### What the login gate was
- Enforced in `app/src/main/java/com/newsmead/activities/SplashActivity.kt`
  (the `LAUNCHER` activity, see `AndroidManifest.xml`).
- Check: `if (auth.currentUser != null)` — a **Firebase Authentication** check
  (`FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser`). Not a local session token, not a
  `newsmead-api` call. If a Firebase user existed → `MainActivity` (home);
  otherwise → `AccountActivity` sign-up/login.
- `MainActivity` hosts `nav_graph.xml`, whose `startDestination` is already
  `homeFragment`. So the only thing gating the home screen was that one `if`.

### The change (smallest, reversible, non-destructive)
Added a feature flag in `SplashActivity` and short-circuited the auth check:

```kotlin
companion object {
    const val BYPASS_LOGIN = true   // false = restore normal login/sign-up flow
}
...
if (BYPASS_LOGIN || auth.currentUser != null) {
    navigateToMainActivity()
}
```

- All login code (LogInFragment, SignUpFragment, AccountActivity, Firebase) is
  left fully intact for later reference. Flip `BYPASS_LOGIN` to `false` to revert.
- Launch now goes straight to `MainActivity` → `homeFragment`.

### Known secondary consideration (feed content)
- Article/home content comes from a **public REST API** (Volley GETs to
  `newsmead.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com`) that does **not** require a
  Firebase token — see `DataHelper.loadArticleData()`. Browsing by
  category/source/search uses the `/articles/?…` endpoint and works with no login.
- BUT the **default home feed** hits `…/recommendations/{uid}`, where
  `uid = FirebaseHelper.getUid()`. With no Firebase user, `getUid()` returns the
  literal string `"null"`, so the request becomes `…/recommendations/null`.
  If the recommender rejects an unknown uid, the **default home feed may be
  empty** (screen still renders; list just comes back empty).
  - Server behavior for `recommendations/null` was not verifiable at edit time
    (the Azure host was unreachable from the dev sandbox).
  - If the feed comes up empty on-device, the smallest fix is to fall back to the
    generic `/articles/` endpoint when `uid == "null"` inside
    `DataHelper.loadArticleData()` (the code already knows how to parse that
    response). Not applied yet — pending confirmation of actual server behavior.
- Firebase-backed features (Saved lists, History, Profile) already guard on
  `uid == "null"` and degrade gracefully to a "Please login" toast — no crash.

### Build note
- The project's kapt is **incompatible with JDK 21** (fails with
  `module jdk.compiler does not export com.sun.tools.javac.main`). This is a
  pre-existing environment issue, unrelated to this change.
- Build with **JDK 17** instead, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`:
  `JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17"; ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin`
- Verified: `:app:compileDebugKotlin` → **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** with this change.
  Full on-device home-screen confirmation still requires an emulator/device.
