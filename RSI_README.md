# Reading State Index (RSI) Guide

This document explains how to interpret the `GazeRSI` logs produced by the NewsMead gaze-reading prototype.

RSI is a reading-effort signal. It is not a quiz score, comprehension score, medical measure, or final diagnosis of reading ability. It summarizes gaze behavior while a participant reads an article.

## Example Log

```text
GazeRSI: score=81.6 reg=1.00 dwell=0.95 fix=0.33 events=f15/d21354ms/r58
```

Read this as:

- `score=81.6`: composite reading-effort score from 0 to 100.
- `reg=1.00`: normalized regression component.
- `dwell=0.95`: normalized dwell-time component.
- `fix=0.33`: normalized fixation-rate component.
- `events=f15/d21354ms/r58`: raw event counts used to produce the score.

## Score Meaning

Higher RSI means the system detected more reading effort. Lower RSI means the reading pattern looked smoother.

| Score Range | Level | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0-30` | Low effort | Reading appears smooth. Few rereads, short hesitation, and stable forward progress. |
| `31-60` | Moderate effort | Some pauses, rereading, or attention shifts. This can be normal depending on text difficulty. |
| `61-80` | High effort | Frequent pausing, rereading, or unstable movement across lines. The reader may be struggling or reading carefully. |
| `81-100` | Very high effort | Strong signal of difficulty, confusion, fatigue, distraction, or noisy gaze calibration. Inspect raw metrics before interpreting. |

Use the score as a flag for review. A high score tells the researcher to inspect the raw `GazeRSI` events and the calibration quality.

## How The Score Is Computed

The current implementation combines three normalized components:

```text
score = 100 * (
  0.40 * regressionComponent +
  0.35 * dwellComponent +
  0.25 * fixationComponent
)
```

Weights:

| Component | Weight | Why it matters |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Regression | `40%` | Looking back to earlier lines is often the strongest sign of rereading or confusion. |
| Dwell | `35%` | Spending longer on lines suggests hesitation, careful reading, or processing difficulty. |
| Fixation | `25%` | Repeated stable fixations show the reader is stopping on text rather than smoothly scanning. |

## Raw Metrics

### Fixations: `f`

Example:

```text
events=f15
```

`f15` means 15 fixations were detected.

A fixation is counted when gaze stays on the same line for at least `300ms`.

Interpretation:

| Fixation Pattern | Possible Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Low fixation count | Smooth reading, skimming, or weak gaze detection. |
| Moderate fixation count | Normal reading with occasional pauses. |
| High fixation count | Careful reading, difficulty, fatigue, or tracking instability. |

### Dwell Time: `d`

Example:

```text
events=d21354ms
```

`d21354ms` means the reader spent a total of `21.354 seconds` dwelling on detected text lines.

A dwell event is counted when the reader stays on a line for at least `120ms` before moving away.

Interpretation:

| Dwell Pattern | Possible Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Low dwell | Fast reading, skimming, or gaze not landing consistently on text. |
| Moderate dwell | Normal line-by-line reading. |
| High dwell | Careful reading, hesitation, difficult text, distraction, or poor calibration. |

### Regressions: `r`

Example:

```text
events=r58
```

`r58` means 58 regressions were detected.

A regression is a confirmed move from a later line back to an earlier line, for example:

```text
line 21 -> line 18
```

The current logic filters out small gaze jitter. A regression only counts when:

```text
upward jump is at least 2 lines
and gaze stays on the earlier line for at least 300ms
```

Interpretation:

| Regression Count | Short Reading Sample Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| `r0-r5` | Normal or smooth reading. |
| `r6-r15` | Some rereading or careful checking. |
| `r16-r30` | Heavy rereading, possible difficulty, or unstable gaze. |
| `r30+` | Suspicious. Check calibration, gaze jitter, and whether the article was long. |

High regression counts can mean real rereading, but they can also mean the gaze dot is jumping between lines because calibration is poor.

## Component Fields

### `reg`

Regression component:

```text
regressionComponent = regressionCount / linesRead
```

It is capped at `1.0`.

A high `reg` value means regressions are frequent relative to how far the reader has progressed in the article.

### `dwell`

Dwell component:

```text
dwellComponent = totalDwellMs / elapsedMs
```

It is capped at `1.0`.

A high `dwell` value means most of the session time was spent dwelling on detected lines.

### `fix`

Fixation component:

```text
fixationRatePerMinute = fixationCount / elapsedMinutes
fixationComponent = fixationRatePerMinute / 120
```

It is capped at `1.0`.

A high `fix` value means the reader is producing many stable fixations per minute compared with the current reference rate of `120 fixations/minute`.

## Practical Interpretation

Use these combinations when reviewing logs:

| Pattern | Likely Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Low score, low `r`, moderate `dwell` | Smooth reading. |
| Medium score, moderate `dwell`, low `r` | Careful but stable reading. |
| High score, high `dwell`, low `r` | The reader may be pausing or processing difficult text without rereading much. |
| High score, high `r` | Rereading, confusion, or calibration jitter. Inspect gaze overlay and line logs. |
| Very high score with `r30+` | Treat as suspicious until calibration quality is confirmed. |
| Low score with very low raw events | The tracker may not be detecting gaze reliably. Check `GazeAOI` and overlay behavior. |

## Calibration And Noise Caveats

RSI depends on gaze quality. Before interpreting a high score, check:

- The red gaze dot follows the reader's approximate gaze location.
- `GazeAOI` line numbers move mostly forward during normal reading.
- Regressions are not caused by rapid line bouncing.
- Phone and participant posture stayed stable after calibration.
- The phone remained within the laptop screen tracking area.
- Lighting and face visibility were stable.

A score like this is suspicious:

```text
score=81.6 reg=1.00 dwell=0.95 fix=0.33 events=f15/d21354ms/r58
```

It indicates very high effort, but `r58` is high enough that the first interpretation should be: check calibration and jitter before claiming the reader was confused.

## Recommended Reporting Language

Use cautious language in reports:

- Good: "The RSI score suggests increased reading effort."
- Good: "The high regression count may indicate rereading or gaze instability."
- Good: "This segment should be reviewed with calibration quality and raw line logs."
- Avoid: "The reader definitely did not understand the text."
- Avoid: "The score is a comprehension grade."

## Summary

- Low RSI: smoother reading pattern.
- High RSI: more detected reading effort.
- High `r`: possible rereading, but also possible tracking noise.
- High `dwell`: longer time spent on lines.
- High `fix`: more frequent stable stops on text.
- Always interpret RSI together with raw events, article length, session duration, and calibration quality.
