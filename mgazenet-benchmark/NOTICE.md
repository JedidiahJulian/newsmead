The public MGazeNet `base.mnn` and adapted GazeFollower preprocessing/crop
algorithms come from Gancheng Zhu's GazeFollower, pinned to
`553920edcb7998c029828677f50f6d8eb4a16249` (v1.0.2).
Upstream declares Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0.
The adaptations in `GazeGeometry.kt`, `Preprocessor.kt`, and the corresponding
reference preprocessing in `tools/gaze/mgazenet/reference.py` retain that license.
Changes include Kotlin/Android buffers, NCHW packing for the Session API,
explicit invalid-input handling, and synthetic-only reference checks.

`d407447ed56c4121a11ccbd266dc184ca1ead0c2`, under Apache 2.0.
`MNNNetNative.java` retains the upstream JNI names and signatures, with only
the CPU methods needed for this benchmark exposed.

The explicit vendor fetch places the full GazeFollower and MNN license texts
in APK assets under `notices/`. The benchmark also uses OpenCV, AndroidX,
MediaPipe, and the C++ runtime supplied with MNN; their respective upstream
terms continue to apply. This isolated research build grants no additional
rights to the pretrained models and is not a commercial distribution approval.
