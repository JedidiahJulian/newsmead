# MGazeNet stationary pilot results — 2026-09-08 to 2026-09-09

Status: prospective descriptive pilot in progress. Both predeclared fresh
SM-G991B sessions and A56 session 1 are complete and retained; A56 session 2
has not run. No accuracy gate or promotion decision is assigned. Read after
`gaze-mgazenet-stationary-v2.md`.

## Participant conditions and validity note

For the first SM-G991B session, the participant reported no glasses, a viewing
distance around 30 cm with ordinary somewhat-closer/somewhat-farther variation,
a lighted room, and medium screen brightness described as neither too bright
nor too dark. The participant later disclosed being very fatigued during both
SM-G991B sessions, without good sleep for approximately two weeks and without
expecting that to resolve soon. A56 session 1 was explicitly declared to use
the same conditions as SM-G991B session 2: no glasses, approximately the same
distance and screen brightness, at night in the same lighted room with slightly
dimmer ambient light, and the same severe-fatigue context. These are
self-reported conditions, not measured sleep, illumination, distance or clinical
assessments. Natural small distance variation was not treated as a protocol
failure or estimated from face scale.

Fatigue could affect target fixation, blinks, eye movement, posture and task
compliance, but this harness cannot quantify those pathways or subtract them
from tracker error. All three completed runs are therefore fatigue-context
feasibility evidence, not clean rested-condition estimator benchmarks. The
disclosure does not justify discarding unfavorable samples or retroactively
correcting any run.

## SM-G991B session 1 — forward then reverse

- Run label: `g991b_s1_forward_reverse`
- Session ID: `1788837575199_9f02f7ae-9d34-4ac2-8f7b-6beedde25cf3`
- Outcome: complete
- Report SHA-256: `d21aac066af1c3af0a4e88a790b7a9102ec09062590cd2e0b73c90eef956f39f`
- Offline summary SHA-256: `f39db85fdc8e15ff1729523c5d5acd025eeea4ed5047d97125df3ee7096afb2e`

The integrity-checked numeric record and derived summary are retained under
`diagnostics-local/2026-09-08/mgazenet-stationary-v2/sm-g991b/session-1-forward-reverse/`.
The scorer verified the v2 manifest, pipeline binding, exact forward/reverse
order, all twenty block identities/timings, ten repeated locations, fixed
50/100/200/500 ms sensitivity ages, and absence of fit/test coordinate overlap.

The 1080×2400 screen produced viewport `[33.75,383.75,1046.25,2153.75]`
and 118 px line height. The pinned 640×480/rotation-270 camera path produced
upright 480×640 input with the GPU localizer and four-thread default-precision
MNN estimator. APK SHA-256 was
`8ac48a8e51d3c9e3939e5c146b95c0ae06b1426fc3b2b65325b95adfb574a611`.

Calibration accepted exactly 45 rows at each of thirteen fit targets (585
rows), plus 45 practice rows. It recorded no rejected calibration result. The
fit digest is
`a15723517358482122799ba4a66b56b1fbb51ad8375cf544c190c60106b09b12`.
This complete calibration is not evidence that every fixation was compliant.

### Session and sweep summaries

All 20 planned blocks and all 10 locations contributed. Across the fixed 50,000
ms of measurement time, 375 results were received and all 375 contained an
admitted coordinate; there were zero explicit nulls and zero off-text
coordinates. Thirty-five results arrived after their capture window ended and
remain in the spatial summaries and timing record.

| Scope | Coordinates | mean dx px | mean dy px | 2-D median / P95 / max px | vertical median / P95 / max lines | exact line | within one line | age median / P95 / max ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Whole session | 375 | +44.4 | -75.3 | 108.8 / 232.2 / 979.2 | 0.76 / 1.82 / 8.30 | 31.7% | 85.3% | 219.8 / 281.1 / 357.1 |
| Sweep 1, forward | 195 | +40.0 | -78.3 | 106.8 / 220.7 / 641.5 | 0.76 / 1.72 / 2.13 | 29.7% | 87.2% | 214.4 / 275.4 / 303.7 |
| Sweep 2, reverse | 180 | +49.2 | -72.1 | 113.0 / 232.4 / 979.2 | 0.77 / 1.88 / 8.30 | 33.9% | 83.3% | 225.1 / 287.2 / 357.1 |

Target-balanced results across all ten contributing locations were: mean
location median 2-D error 114.9 px; mean location P95 227.9 px; mean location
maximum 349.3 px; mean location median/P95/maximum vertical error
0.81/1.39/2.38 lines; mean signed X/Y bias +45.2/-74.2 px; mean exact-line
fraction 32.2%; and mean within-one-line fraction 85.3%. An empty location would
have remained missing rather than contributing zero, but there were no empty
locations here.

### Per-target/sweep spatial results

`dx` and `dy` are coordinate-mean signed bias. `SDx`/`SDy` use sample standard
deviation (`n-1`) around that block's coordinate mean. Spatial statistics use
every admitted coordinate and do not change with freshness age.

| Block | n | dx / dy px | 2-D median / P95 / max px | vertical median / P95 / max lines | exact / within-one | SDx / SDy px |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 grid 2 | 18 | +87.4 / +58.4 | 60.9 / 641.5 / 641.5 | 0.38 / 1.10 / 1.10 | 61.1% / 100% | 200.0 / 33.7 |

| S1 grid 44 | 20 | -1.9 / -108.2 | 114.0 / 173.9 / 195.0 | 0.94 / 1.33 / 1.47 | 5.0% / 100% | 45.8 / 30.6 |
| S2 grid 44 | 20 | +37.8 / -110.9 | 123.3 / 162.3 / 171.8 | 0.94 / 1.12 / 1.34 | 0% / 100% | 44.4 / 20.0 |
| S2 grid 38 | 19 | +81.2 / -106.3 | 142.1 / 204.4 / 204.4 | 0.81 / 1.51 / 1.51 | 10.5% / 94.7% | 42.4 / 33.9 |
| S2 grid 33 | 18 | +58.9 / -132.2 | 214.3 / 403.1 / 403.1 | 1.72 / 3.10 / 3.10 | 5.6% / 22.2% | 64.3 / 171.0 |
| S2 grid 31 | 16 | +83.9 / -202.0 | 223.0 / 259.6 / 259.6 | 1.72 / 2.03 / 2.03 | 0% / 18.8% | 30.1 / 23.9 |
| S2 grid 24 | 19 | +97.6 / -103.7 | 153.8 / 177.4 / 177.4 | 0.87 / 1.29 / 1.29 | 0% / 100% | 33.9 / 21.3 |
| S2 grid 22 | 18 | -30.3 / -67.4 | 70.2 / 130.9 / 130.9 | 0.54 / 1.10 / 1.10 | 38.9% / 100% | 22.7 / 30.8 |
| S2 grid 15 | 18 | +51.1 / -64.0 | 97.8 / 181.3 / 181.3 | 0.63 / 1.50 / 1.50 | 44.4% / 94.4% | 38.8 / 71.6 |
| S2 grid 13 | 19 | +60.4 / -47.9 | 85.0 / 151.6 / 151.6 | 0.34 / 1.21 / 1.21 | 63.2% / 100% | 27.4 / 47.8 |
| S2 grid 8 | 17 | -0.6 / +80.2 | 35.0 / 979.2 / 979.2 | 0.21 / 8.30 / 8.30 | 94.1% / 94.1% | 29.7 / 231.7 |
| S2 grid 2 | 16 | +49.6 / +46.8 | 64.5 / 113.7 / 113.7 | 0.37 / 0.57 / 0.57 | 93.8% / 100% | 32.1 / 9.7 |

The extreme tails are retained. Sweep-1 grid 2 included two >400 px 2-D
samples 615-790 ms into its measurement window. Sweep-2 grid 33 included one
403 px sample, and sweep-2 grid 8 included one 979 px/8.30-line sample about
1,165 ms into its window. Their capture times are inside the stable measurement
windows, so the scorer does not discard them. They may mix tracker error with
participant movement/compliance; this session cannot separate those causes.

### Same-location bias change

Values are sweep 2 minus sweep 1 coordinate-mean signed bias.

| Grid | ΔX px | ΔY px |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2 | -37.8 | -11.6 |
| 8 | -47.9 | +51.3 |
| 13 | +37.5 | +74.1 |
| 15 | -1.9 | +44.1 |
| 22 | -65.7 | +7.5 |
| 24 | +26.9 | -71.2 |
| 31 | +36.5 | -49.8 |
| 33 | +11.0 | +47.8 |
| 38 | +83.9 | -33.5 |
| 44 | +39.7 | -2.6 |

These changes vary in sign and magnitude by location. They are observed
within-session bias changes, not a causal drift estimate.

### Fixed freshness sensitivity

| Maximum capture age | coordinate availability | exact-line availability | within-one-line availability |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 50 ms | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 100 ms | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 200 ms | 0.31% | 0.03% | 0.18% |
| 500 ms | 88.63% | 28.21% | 76.42% |

These are target-balanced fractions of planned measurement time, not sample
accuracy and not acceptance thresholds. Median output age was 219.8 ms, so the
50 and 100 ms columns necessarily have no available coordinate time. Even the
200 ms column has almost none. At 500 ms, the worst within-block unavailable
interval was 419.8 ms. The full table is retained; the 500 ms column is not
selected as a favorable replacement threshold.

Across the whole run, CameraX delivered 3,877 analyzer arrivals and the
single-owner analyzer observed 2,127 busy drops (54.9%). CameraX-undelivered
frames are not observable. No resource-close error occurred. These counters
span practice, calibration, settling and validation, so they are operational
context rather than a test-window sample denominator.

## SM-G991B session 2 — reverse then forward

- Run label: `g991b_s2_reverse_forward`
- Session ID: `1788888496569_3a72ea87-d398-48b8-b6cb-6012dcbae791`
- Outcome: complete
- Report SHA-256: `449f98623549c27479f60d82959468efc89a8f515a696a8d5764bdd13184169a`
- Offline summary SHA-256: `523988b9dbeab891bbf10da6889fad769d7648c514868772384685b8765fd565`

The integrity-checked record and summary are retained under
`diagnostics-local/2026-09-09/mgazenet-stationary-v2/sm-g991b/session-2-reverse-forward/`.
The record independently verifies `reverse_then_forward`, all twenty blocks,
the same v2 pipeline and layout contract, and a fresh 585-row calibration. Its
fit digest,
`a09923f85f3ecc0e78b642709b05b93baf7654e753e483ddc7fd44a14cb52580`,
differs from session 1. All thirteen fit targets and the practice target accepted
45 rows without an eligibility rejection.

The participant retrospectively confirmed the same no-glasses, approximate
distance, room lighting and medium-brightness conditions for session 2. It was
nighttime and the room was slightly dimmer, though still lighted and not reported
as a large change. The same severe-fatigue disclosure applies to this run.

### Session and sweep summaries

All 20 blocks and 10 locations contributed. Across 50,000 ms of measurement,
349 results were received and all had admitted coordinates. Five coordinates
were outside every text band; they remain in spatial error but are not counted
as correct line assignments. There were no explicit null results. Thirty-three
outputs arrived after their capture window ended.

| Scope | Coordinates | mean dx px | mean dy px | 2-D median / P95 / max px | vertical median / P95 / max lines | exact line | within one line | age median / P95 / max ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |

| Sweep 1, reverse | 180 | -6.8 | +80.1 | 125.8 / 229.1 / 304.0 | 0.76 / 1.69 / 2.18 | 37.2% | 86.7% | 228.3 / 270.5 / 322.3 |
| Sweep 2, forward | 169 | -115.6 | +123.4 | 183.2 / 308.9 / 1443.7 | 1.00 / 2.11 / 12.12 | 29.6% | 79.3% | 245.4 / 311.5 / 332.8 |

Target-balanced results across ten contributing locations were: mean location
median/P95/maximum 2-D error 147.9/331.2/412.7 px; mean location
median/P95/maximum vertical error 0.81/2.18/2.82 lines; mean signed X/Y bias
-59.6/+99.9 px; mean exact-line fraction 33.6%; and mean within-one-line
fraction 83.5%.

Sweep-2 grid 8 contains three >400 px samples 280-547 ms into its stable
measurement window; the largest is 1,443.7 px/12.12 lines. All have finite
coordinates and capture/output clocks and are retained. Five session coordinates
are off the rendered text bands. As in session 1, participant movement/compliance
and tracker error cannot be separated post hoc.

### Same-location bias change

Values are sweep 2 minus sweep 1 coordinate-mean signed bias within session 2.

| Grid | ΔX px | ΔY px |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2 | -17.8 | -3.1 |
| 8 | +86.9 | +159.2 |
| 13 | -36.9 | -54.4 |
| 15 | -11.1 | +69.1 |
| 22 | -165.3 | +32.2 |
| 24 | -281.6 | +65.1 |
| 31 | -153.4 | +126.4 |
| 33 | -302.3 | +38.7 |
| 38 | -54.5 | -15.0 |
| 44 | -184.1 | -1.6 |

### Fixed freshness sensitivity

| Maximum capture age | coordinate availability | exact-line availability | within-one-line availability |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 50 ms | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 100 ms | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 200 ms | 0.0005% | 0% | 0.0005% |
| 500 ms | 87.45% | 29.09% | 72.68% |

The worst 500 ms within-block unavailable interval was 392.2 ms. CameraX
delivered 3,495 analyzer arrivals and 1,834 were observed busy drops (52.5%).
No resource-close error occurred.

The integrity-checked record and derived summary are retained under
`diagnostics-local/2026-09-09/mgazenet-stationary-v2/sm-a56/session-1-forward-reverse/`.
The scorer independently verified `forward_then_reverse`, all twenty block
identities and timings, ten repeated locations, fixed 50/100/200/500 ms
sensitivity ages, and absence of fit/test coordinate overlap.

The 1080×2340 screen produced viewport `[33.75,404.75,1046.25,1972.75]`
and 98 px line height. The pinned camera, localizer, estimator and APK identities
match the frozen v2 package. Calibration accepted 45 rows at each of thirteen
fit targets (585 rows), plus 45 practice rows. One eye-area rejection occurred
at practice, fit grid 1 and fit grid 5 before each block reached its required 45
accepted rows. The fit digest is
`a30b9996fb388b59ccd998d3b853f9fc981e2f639e09550789d5276370a9030f`.

The participant explicitly authorized the run when ready and declared the same
conditions as SM-G991B session 2. The shared fatigue and slightly dimmer
nighttime-room limitations above therefore apply prospectively to this session.

### Session and sweep summaries

All 20 blocks and 10 locations contributed. Across 50,000 ms of measurement,
358 results were received and all had admitted coordinates; there were no
explicit null results. Fifty-three coordinates were outside every rendered text
band, and 33 outputs arrived after their capture window ended. Both sets remain
in the spatial and timing record.

Target-balanced results across ten contributing locations were: mean location
median/P95/maximum 2-D error 102.8/206.9/240.0 px; mean location
median/P95/maximum vertical error 0.61/1.65/2.07 lines; mean signed X/Y bias
-6.1/-36.2 px; mean exact-line fraction 32.2%; and mean within-one-line
fraction 78.9%.

The two >400 px samples occurred in sweep-2 grid 44, 2,135 and 2,269 ms
after its stable measurement window began. The largest was 669.1 px/6.19
lines. Both have finite coordinates and clocks and remain included. Forty-nine
of the 53 off-text coordinates occurred at the two right-edge locations, grids
8 and 44; the other four occurred at sweep-2 grid 38. This concentration is
reported rather than used to redefine the text bands or line-assignment metric.

### Same-location bias change

Values are sweep 2 minus sweep 1 coordinate-mean signed bias within the A56
session.

| Grid | ΔX px | ΔY px |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2 | +58.9 | +32.5 |
| 8 | +21.4 | -12.1 |
| 13 | -37.4 | +33.9 |
| 15 | -42.2 | -5.4 |
| 22 | -29.4 | -20.8 |
| 24 | -63.9 | +94.8 |
| 31 | +2.0 | -10.6 |

### Fixed freshness sensitivity

| Maximum capture age | coordinate availability | exact-line availability | within-one-line availability |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 50 ms | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 100 ms | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 200 ms | 0.25% | 0.18% | 0.25% |
| 500 ms | 86.95% | 28.38% | 69.13% |

The worst 500 ms within-block unavailable interval was 458.1 ms. CameraX
delivered 3,574 analyzer arrivals and 1,872 were observed busy drops (52.4%).
No resource-close error occurred. CAMERA was revoked, its effective app-op was
set to ignore, and the isolated app was force-stopped after preservation.

The fresh calibration and reversed order did not reproduce a stable signed bias:
both mean axes changed sign, while exact-line performance remained close to one
third and within-one-line remained near 83-85%. Session 2 worsened the 2-D
median/tail and output age. The first A56 session has the lowest typical spatial
and vertical errors of the three completed sessions and a similar exact-line
fraction, but its within-one-line fraction is lower and 53 coordinates are
off-text. These observations are not a device ranking: the A56 has only one
completed order, each run has its own calibration, and pooling frames would hide
session and order variability.

### Relation to the historical tracker evidence

The 0.59, 0.76 and 0.87-line session medians are within the better range
previously recorded for other NewsMead gaze configurations. The retained eye-local work
reported 0.62/2.07 and 0.96/1.51-line live median/maximum pairs (E-045); the
stronger E-054 A56 reading run reported 1/2-line median/P95, 36.0% exact-line and
85.4% within-one-line; and the stronger SM compact-candidate replication reported
0.83/2.09-line held-out median/maximum (E-071). In that limited sense, the
MGazeNet typical vertical errors are encouraging and broadly comparable.

They are not a matched superiority result. The MGazeNet task uses stationary red
points centered inside line bands, while E-054 used reading behavior and the
historical target protocols, sample aggregation and runtime paths differ. The
MGazeNet sessions also retain 6.19/8.30/12.12-line sample maxima, approximately
32-34% exact-line assignment, off-text coordinates, session-level bias changes
and weak sub-200 ms availability. Therefore neither the median nor the historical
range is enough to label the full signal accurate for reading events.

## Interpretation and next boundary

The three completed observations establish neither reliable reading events nor
a pass. Typical A56 session-1 vertical error is encouraging, but it does not
erase roughly one-third exact-line
accuracy, multi-line P95/max tails, weak sub-200 ms availability, regional
variation, off-text results, or bias changes between sweeps and fresh
calibrations. No filter, correction, threshold or target was tuned after any
run, and no completed session will be repeated to obtain a favorable result.

The one remaining predeclared observation is a fresh A56 session 2 in
reverse-then-forward order after rest/repositioning. Do not launch it immediately
or merely to complete the table. Ongoing fatigue remains an uncontrolled
validity and comfort limitation; camera use and personal calibration require a
new explicit readiness/comfort confirmation. Keep all three completed sessions
separate in later tables. CAMERA was revoked and the isolated app was
force-stopped after every preserved session.
