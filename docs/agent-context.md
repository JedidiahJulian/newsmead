# Agent context — updated 2026-09-30

This is a routing note, not a new research protocol. Recheck source and newer
dated evidence before continuing. It summarizes the project's recent tasks and
local documentation to avoid loading full histories each time.

Use the upstream `scientific-critical-thinking` skill for evidence appraisal and
`statistical-analysis` for statistical planning and interpretation. Their source,
revision and validation limits are in `docs/codex-agent-workflow.md`. The custom
project skills were retired at the user's request. This note and the measurement
protocol remain authoritative for NewsMead-specific decisions and tools.

## Objective and current direction

Help older adults sustain attentive reading through real-time visual assistance
in the on-device Android NewsMead prototype. The immediate development priority
is to complete the integrated live scanpath-to-visual-aid prototype before
participant measurement/evaluation. Build software replay checks during
implementation; carry forward existing gaze evidence. The user explicitly
allows continuous, combined, or variable
intensity scaffolds; four mutually exclusive levels are an existing implementation,
not a fixed requirement for future research. Re-entry is only one possible use.

Owner clarification on 2026-09-30: visual help need not be called scaffolds or
organized as levels. Replace the legacy design when a better suited,
study-defensible design exists. The [aid design and evidence contract](scanpath-adaptive-aid-design.md)
now specifies independent aid types with within-type strength, per-rule source
provenance and exact trigger/form/outcome limits. Prioritize line guidance and
localized word support; optional ruler and word-progress forms get distinct
versioned IDs. Preserve A4's focus-region meaning rather than pooling variants.
No forceful intervention follows every return/cycle, and poor tracking cannot
increase assumed difficulty. This is a design checkpoint; runtime migration
remains pending and participant evaluation follows the integrated build.

The [scanpath-to-visual-aid implementation proposal](adaptive-visual-aid-proposal.md)
is the current **NewsMead feature specification**. Re-reading the source task
**Explore feasible gaze metrics** clarified the owner's final intent: preserve
ordered gaze-to-text visits, classify **observable navigation patterns**, then
select or parameterize visual help. The owner subsequently clarified that the
proposal must derive and evaluate **both word-level and line-level** scanpaths,
trace the order categories to primary papers, and connect each visual aid to
the observed situation it might address. Word-level analysis is a feasibility
track despite weak current exact-word placement. Slow line progression to a
focus window is an experimental mapping with no identified direct intervention
evidence; window restrictions may remove useful parafoveal text. A universal
reading-instability construct, supervised support-need model, and fixed
four-scaffold ladder are **not** required. Aid type, target, strength, duration,
and combination may vary during ordinary reading; the candidate policy and its
benefit must be independently tested. The current proposal specifies code
boundaries, derivation, a descriptive classifier, a configurable aid policy,
primary-study precedents, and separate measurement, pattern, and intervention
gates. An
[illustrated PDF companion](../output/pdf/newsmead-scanpath-visual-aid-proposal.pdf)
shows the same derivation, order-to-aid bridge, and proposed UI states; its
examples are schematic, not observed NewsMead scanpaths. The earlier
[three-state line-guide research plan](adaptive-visual-aid-research-plan.md)
is retained as a historical narrower option, not the current requirement.
The [known-interruption bookmark](evidence-backed-reading-support-proposal.md)
and [fixed pattern/scaffold proposal](scanpath-scaffolding-proposal.md) are
historical options. The [critical audit](gaze-proposal-evidence-audit.md) still
applies to unsupported line-pattern meanings and aid mappings; the
[primary-study ledger](scanpath-scaffolding-evidence.md) records evidence and
transfer limits. An HSMM is at most an offline exploration; the old weighted
score and Mahalanobis distance do not establish reading instability. Preserve
useful rereading and abstain across ambiguous or missing gaze. The thesis source
still describes the legacy index and a circular recovery-latency endpoint;
align it only after the method and independent outcome are fixed.

The [order-category provenance table](scanpath-scaffolding-evidence.md#provenance-of-the-proposed-order-categories)
identifies Olivier's word-distance alphabet and Yamaya's multiline segment
classes as precedents, while marking NewsMead's physical-line bins as original
operational definitions. Preserve separate fixation-level word transitions,
word visits, and line visits. Olivier's same-word `Rfx` is not a long line hold;
`HOLD` is duration, not order; `BREAK` marks missing sequence continuity. The
historical forward multi-line symbol `FWD_LONG` (formerly `FWD_SKIP`) must not
imply that intervening text was unread.

The [published sequence-to-behavior table](scanpath-sequence-behavior-table.md)
is the current lookup for the exact word, segment, line, and longer-path labels
used in the proposal. It separates observed geometry from model/author
interpretations and maps NewsMead arrow examples only as proposed descriptors.
The [pattern ground-truth audit](scanpath-pattern-ground-truth-audit.md) identifies
which studies used human movement annotations, known geometry, instructed tasks,
experimental text conditions, or exploratory clusters. Exact line cycles such as
`L4 -> L5 -> L4 -> L5` remain NewsMead illustrations, not validated difficulty
classes.
The [original figure reading guide](scanpath-source-figure-guide.md) links directly
to primary-source pages and images for NN/g's named web patterns, the 2026
anchor-search-confirm process, sentence-region rereading prototypes, Hyönä's
expository reading profiles, Parshina's sentence-path prototypes, and Chen's
task-reading strategy transitions. It distinguishes individual gaze plots from
heatmaps, aggregate profiles, and authors' explanatory figures and records
task/evidence limits. Do not substitute generated redraws for original figures
when the owner asks for verifiable paths.
The [reading-difficulty scanpath evidence guide](scanpath-reading-difficulty-evidence.md)
separately audits paths against independent reading-skill, comprehension, and
controlled-difficulty outcomes, with original figure and table locations. No
reviewed named path is a conclusive live difficulty sign for older adults reading
news on a phone. Notably, regressive paths relate differently to comprehension
across genres, and news-page gaze studies found so far do not validate a
path-to-difficulty outcome. Its quantitative audit shows that published cluster
shares, correlations, model coefficients, R², and benchmark AUROCs are not
calibrated `P(current difficulty | path)` or aid-benefit weights. Preserve
candidate paths as observations pending NewsMead measurement, independent
outcome prediction, calibration, and randomized aid-benefit tests; low gaze
quality is an abstention reason, not a difficulty signal. The current
[implementation proposal](adaptive-visual-aid-proposal.md#confidence-and-weights-for-adaptive-decisions)
records how a future weighted policy would be learned and gated.
The [classification dictionary](scanpath-classification-map.md) and its
[table-form PDF](../output/pdf/newsmead-scanpath-classification-map.pdf) group
movement labels, ordered path patterns, empirical whole-path clusters, and
model-inferred phases. Those are different types of labels; sequence length
alone does not define their type. The dictionary names primary studies and
marks NewsMead examples as proposed descriptions rather than published classes.
The [visual-aid evidence map](scanpath-visual-aid-evidence-map.md) and its
[PDF table](../output/pdf/newsmead-scanpath-visual-aid-evidence-map.pdf) connect
those observations to tested aids and separates movement-matched results from
untested NewsMead trigger rules. Current closest aid evidence is for return-
sweep/next-line localization; automatic word magnification after refixation,
focus windows after slow line residence, and cues for spontaneous rereading
remain unvalidated. Preserve context and reader control during rereading.

The [public gaze-sequence capability-model survey](scanpath-capability-models.md)
checks EyeBench and individual LSTM, CNN, transformer, and HSMM precedents against
their actual labels, public code, validation splits, and NewsMead fit. EyeBench is
the strongest offline comparison framework, but its published models do not
validate a live aid-need detector for older phone readers. No candidate model
has been selected for the app, and no task-ready trained weights were verified.
The survey also covers phone front-camera precedents: Lepton, StrategicReading,
and Valliappan et al. A hardware-relevant study may use any text read on a phone;
it need not use news. These studies support testing coarse line/region signals,
but none supplies a public validated model that chooses real-time aid strength.
Lepton's reported comprehension correlation gain comes from scrolling features
in its leave-one-reader-out table, not gaze alone. Preserve that distinction.

MGazeNet has been integrated and optimized. Old July README descriptions and the
September 6 replacement handoff do not describe the latest runtime. Verify the
active provider in source before making tracker claims. Better visible tracking
does not by itself validate word assignment, fixation detection, or an index.

## Current measurement work

- Owner clarification on 2026-09-30: the pilot's objective is to build and evaluate
  the scanpath-to-visual-aid system, carrying forward existing gaze evaluation.
  The owner clarified that measurement tasks follow completion of the prototype.
  [Pilot revision 6](scanpath-measurement-pilot.md) is the current build/evaluation
  plan: six objectives, seven work packages, P01–P13 pattern rules and A0–A4 aid
  candidates, plus separately identified optional ruler/coloring forms. Build
  the Android causal word/line engine, pattern-to-aid policy,
  adjustable renderers with variable strength, reader controls and action/render
  logging first. Complete software replay/build checks and the matched evaluation
  instrument before running participant measurement. Phases then cover prompted feasibility,
  ordinary-reading shadow decisions and independent support-need reports,
  controlled aid/strength trials, then frozen varying-strength evaluation.
  Offline analyzer v5 now includes the [P01–P13 named detector layer](scanpath-detectors.md):
  word/line movements, geometric sweep candidates with explicit endpoint settings
  and verified LTR direction,
  revisit/frontier episodes, structural A–B–A–B cycles, residence/progression
  descriptors and breaks. Long/slow flags require explicit development settings.
  This is offline software, not validated natural eye paths/difficulty. Android
  live extraction and the scanpath-to-aid policy remain pending. Existing
  renderer/legacy controller code must not be described as that implementation.
  Focus new checks on sequence,
  classifier and aid behavior; do not make a broad gaze benchmark restart a
  prerequisite. Raw/smoothed and conditional-reference limits still apply.
  The owner is requesting a stronger research model from the public-model owner;
  artifact/compatibility/performance are unverified. Continue model-versioned
  sequence development and reevaluate affected measurements when supplied.
  Focused detector checks: 39 extraction/integration plus 13 classifier tests
  passed (52 total). Independent review findings on direction, episode phase/
  evidence and censored residence were corrected with regression fixtures.
  Evidence contract: `docs/scanpath-detectors.md`; tests:
  `tools/gaze/test_scanpath_patterns.py` and `test_analyze_reading_measurement.py`.
- The active scanpath preparation branch is `measurement/scanpath-pilot`, created
  from the same commit as `measurement/RII_2` while retaining pre-existing
  uncommitted changes. No scanpath measurement has been run on the device in this
  branch. The [phone-only scanpath measurement pilot](scanpath-measurement-pilot.md)
  specifies separate word and physical-line paths, explicit continuity breaks,
  known-target placement checks, and natural-reading evidence limits. It lists
  descriptive patterns to implement; cognitive labels and validated aid/intensity
  weights are not established. Review the analyzer's
  current `analysis_version` and focused tests before using its outputs. The
  structured v6 target score is based on smoothed displayed coordinates, whereas
  the natural-reading replay uses raw coordinates and raw-derived AOIs; v6's
  current score cannot pass a raw path placement gate. A separate matched raw
  target/order instrument supports evaluation of the completed prototype,
  without changing frozen v6. The offline registry/classifier is implemented;
  build the Android causal engine, policy, adjustable aids and action logging
  next. New participant measurement does not block that implementation. The blank
  record now covers pattern and aid outcomes, condition assignment and holdout
  allocation. Set participant counts, numeric tolerances and study conditions
  from the phase-specific plan before collection; they are not validated defaults.
- The [2026-09-30 pilot audit](scanpath-pilot-audit.md) corrected a timestamp-order
  reversal across replay boundaries and overstated accepted-sample coverage.
  Analysis v4 preserves a global capture timestamp, separates eligibility from
  accepted samples, and reports visit censoring, duration coverage, output age
  and terminal boundary events. Focused suite: 31 tests; independent review
  found no remaining issue in the fixes. Protocol revision 2 requires the same
  calibration through pre-check/read/post-check, current locked 22 dp font,
  matched raw placement plus continuous-order tasks, and a frozen sampling/
  material plan. Use the blank session record privately. This is diagnostic
  preparation, not validated natural-reading or aid behavior.
- Ordinary known-target structured validation is now protocol v6/schema 9: the
  orange gaze dot stays visible and the same article One Euro-smoothed
  coordinates drive display, word/line mapping, and scoring. Raw MGazeNet source
  coordinates remain logged separately. Interpret its output as closed-loop
  article-pipeline UI performance, not unaided estimator accuracy, and do not
  pool it with raw visible-dot v5 or hidden-dot v4 data. The frozen
  matched-comparison path remains raw hidden-dot v4. The interrupted raw-visible
  v5 diagnostic is retained at
  `diagnostics-local/reading_validation_session_20260921_114932_153.jsonl`; the
  preceding hidden-dot evidence is
  `diagnostics-local/reading_validation_session_20260920_190328_306.jsonl`.
- The source task **Explore feasible gaze metrics** reports one completed v6 run
  (`reading_validation_session_20260921_155148_059.jsonl`): 89.3% word-target
  exact-line, 47.5% exact-word, 61.6% guided exact-line, and 99.2% guided
  within-one-line at 22 dp, after recalibration with the visible smoothed dot.
  This is promising closed-loop known-target evidence, not unaided or natural-
  reading line-transition validation. Repeatability, font-size effects, and
  target-population performance remain open.
- `docs/reading-measurement-pilot.md`: specification for raw natural-reading JSONL
  recording and reproducible offline extraction. The requested orange gaze dot
  stays visible; scaffolds and the old adaptation feed are disabled during this
  recording mode. This is a diagnostic-dot condition, not an unassisted study.
- Raw and displayed coordinates are separate. Analysis uses capture timestamps,
  physical-screen geometry, and Android UTF-16 offsets. Coordinate/gaze validity,
  scrolling, changed geometry, ambiguous assignment, and unclassified gaps matter.
- `docs/reading-measurement-run-01.md`: first run is a plumbing/measurement
  diagnostic with user-reported vertical misalignment, not independent accuracy
  ground truth or index validation. The corrected analyzer breaks continuity
  across long unclassified inter-fixation intervals. Sparse retained transitions
  limit sequence claims; do not restore the earlier gap-bridging behavior.
- `tools/gaze/analyze_reading_measurement.py` and
  `tools/gaze/test_analyze_reading_measurement.py`: current offline analysis and
  regression checks. Check the actual test runner and current version before use.
- Candidate fixation, first-pass, rereading, regression, skipping, and scanpath
  features remain provisional. No final RII formula, weights, baseline, or
  replacement online controller is established by this pilot.
- Preserve explicit eligible denominators, undefined rates as `null`, ambiguous
  assignments, censoring and continuity breaks. Use the current analyzer CLI and
  tests from the pilot document; generic statistical utilities do not replace it.
- Repeated windows are not independent participants. Plan participant/session/
  passage separation appropriate to the target claim, account for clustering,
  and prevent evaluation leakage through normalization or future observations.
  Generic assumption-check reports do not establish independence or measurement
  validity; do not automatically remove or winsorize observations they flag.
- `docs/reading-stability-index.md` and `docs/adaptive-visual-scaffolding.md`
  explain the legacy line-event score and rolling controller. They are distinct
  from the new raw-coordinate measurement pipeline.

## Research judgment

Prior tasks discussed scanpath regularity and a personalized multivariate
deviation score. These are candidate approaches, not approved final methods.
Verify each paper's population, hardware, sampling, feature definition, outcome,
and validation split before adapting it. Do not turn an association into a causal,
clinical, or real-time detection claim. Do not assume unusual rereading is harmful;
deliberate careful rereading and tracker noise are alternative explanations.

Select reproducible measurements first; compare candidate indices to independent
labels/outcomes; evaluate scaffolds on reading benefit rather than simply a
reduction in the score used to trigger them. Retain the on-device deployment
objective. Older constraints include both A56 and SM-G991B relevance and no paid
EyeDid or required laptop/WiFi backend; revisit only if the user changes scope.
